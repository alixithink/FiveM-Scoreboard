# FiveM-Scoreboard

There are two scripts included, the main scoreboard script, along with a side script. This script is an addon to the scoreboard, and displays what department the user is in. For example, if someone is playing as Police Department then it will say "[id]" "Department" | "Username" this is not required and if you would like to turn it off you just need to go into the config.lua and change Config.doDept to false.

# Configuration

Within the scoreboard resource you are able to change many things like the following;

- Config.titleTxt: Allows you to change the title of the scoreboard to what ever you would like, for example your server name.
- Config.sbDefault: Gives you the ability to change all the text on the scoreboard.
- Config.civColour: This is the same as sbDefault but it changes the colour of the department indicator.
- Config.pdColour: Same exact configuration as civColour but changes the police indicator.
- Config.fireColour: Same as civColour but for Fire indicator.

All colour settings follow the css language form, if you do not know what this means just use this to pick a colour;
